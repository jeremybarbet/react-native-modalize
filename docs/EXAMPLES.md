# Examples

These three examples are made to show you:

- How to use the modal using different navigators
- How to avoid using the Modal from React Native
- The best practices to display Modalize

?> React Native team will soon remove from the core a lot of components, including the `Modal`. This is why it's not recommended to use [withReactModal](/PROPSMETHODS?id=withreactmodal) props.

?> Most of the major navigators implemented theirs owns ways to handle the modal/overlay behavior. `react-native-navigation` uses the `showOverlay` method and `react-navigation` uses a StackRoot to create the modal route.

## React Native Navigation

This is probably the simplest navigator to handle this bevahior. There is a method called `showOverlay` that will open the Modalize screen on top of the current screen.
