# Available props

All these props are available by passing them to the Modalize component.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Modalize } from 'react-native-modalize';

export const App = () => (
  <Modalize
    ref={modalRef}
    scrollViewProps={{ showsVerticalScrollIndicator: false }}
    snapPoint={300}
    HeaderComponent={<View><Text>Header</Text></View>}
    withHandle={false}
  >
    ...your content
  </Modalize>
);
```

## Renderers

Modalize is shipped by default with three different renderers. The default one is a ScrollView and you just have to pass your content without specifying it directly. If you want to use a FlatList or a SectionList, then you don't have to pass the `children` props, but the `data`/`renderItem` that you can normally find with both of them.

### `children`

A React component that will define the content of the modal. By passing a children props it will use the default `ScrollView` component.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| node     | No       |

### `scrollViewProps`

An object to pass any of the react-native ScrollView's props.

Refer to the [`react-native` ScrollView documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview#props) to find out all the avaibles props.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |
| object   | No       |

### `flatListProps`

An object to pass any of the react-native FlatList's props. Using this props will replace the default `ScrollView` with the `FlatList` component.

Refer to the [`react-native` FlatList documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#props) to find out all the avaibles props.

| Type     | Required |
| -------- | -------- |

### `openAnimationConfig`

Object to change the open animation. You can either pass a timing (`Animated.timing`) or a spring (`Animated.spring`) animation.

| Type     | Required | Default                                    |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| object   | No       | `{ spring: { speed: 14, bounciness: 4 } }` |

**Spring props (default object)**

- `friction`: Controls "bounciness"/overshoot.
- `tension`: Controls speed.
- `speed`: Controls speed of the animation. _Default 14_.
- `bounciness`: Controls bounciness. _Default 4_.

- `damping`: Defines how the springâ€™s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.
- `mass`: The mass of the object attached to the end of the spring.

**Timing props**

- `duration`: Length of animation (milliseconds). _Default 280_.
- `easing`: Easing function to define curve. _Default is `Easing.ease`_.
- `delay`: Start the animation after delay (milliseconds).
- `isInteraction`: Whether or not this animation creates an "interaction handle" on the InteractionManager.

### `closeAnimationConfig`

Object to change the close animation. You can either pass a timing (`Animated.timing`) or a spring (`Animated.spring`) animation. _(See above for spring and timing props)_

| Type     | Required | Default                                    |

| number   | No       | `150`   |

### `velocity`

Speed at which the user has to pan down to close the modal.

The highest the number is, the faster the user will need to pan down and make an important gesture to dismiss the modal.

?> e.g. When the user is reaching the top of the ScrollView and is immediately panning down to dismiss Modalize. If it reaches the velocity threshold then it instantly closes the modal.

?> If the `velocity` is defined, then it's the first condition checked to close Modalize, then comes `threshold` used in a second time. If you want to use the `threshold` method only, just define `velocity={undefined}`.

### `useNativeDriver`

Wether or not you want to use the native driver with the `panGestureAnimatedValue`.
