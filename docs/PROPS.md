# Available props

All these props are available by passing them to the Modalize component.

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { Modalize } from 'react-native-modalize';

export const App = () => (
  <Modalize
    scrollViewProps={{ showsVerticalScrollIndicator: false }}
    snapPoint={300}
    HeaderComponent={
      <View>
        <Text>Header</Text>
      </View>
    }
    withHandle={false}
  >
    ...your content
  </Modalize>
);
```

---

#### Known limitations:

- Modalize uses internally `onScrollBeginDrag` method to be able to handle the swipe gestures. If you decide to use it on your side with `scrollViewProps`, `flatListProps` or `sectionListProps` object, you will only have access to the listener of the `onScrollBeginDrag` method as you can see [here](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/react-native-modalize/blob/master/src/index.tsx#L611) and not the whole event like default.

- Because of a limitation with react-native-gesture-handler, `HeaderComponent`, `FooterComponent` and `FloatingComponent` are not wrapped with a PanGestureHandler on Android, which mean you cannot dismiss Modalize by swiping down on these three components. If enabled, the inner events you could have in your components (e.g. TouchableOpacity, ScrollView) are cancels and don't work. Opposed to iOS that works just fine.

- When using some third-party library (e.g. expo-av/react-native-video), it's impossible to press any of the native controls. This is a limitation created by the `TapGestureHandler` wrapping the whole Modalize's core component. In short, we need it to make sure we don't scroll and swipe at the same time. As a workaround, we now have a props `tapGestureEnabled` to be able to disable it and press in your third-party library. The only downside that can appear when using `tapGestureEnabled: false` is when you use it along with `snapPoint` props. The ScrollView could be triggered, for a few pixels, at the same time as the swipe gesture.

- If you are using a `TextInput` component inside your Modalize, it seems to be intercepting all touch events. You can follow this issue on both [#123](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/react-native-modalize/issues/123) and [#668](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/issues/668).

## Refs

### `ref`

A ref on Modalize component to be able to use the internal methods [`open()`](/METHODS.md?id=open) and [`close()`](/METHODS.md?id=close).

```tsx
import { Modalize } from 'react-native-modalize';

const App = () => {
  const modalizeRef = useRef<Modalize>(null);

  // e.g. modalizeRef.current?.open() or modalizeRef.current?.close()

  return <Modalize ref={modalizeRef} />;
};
```

| Type            | Required |
| --------------- | -------- |
| React.RefObject | Yes      |

### `contentRef`

A reference to the view (ScrollView, FlatList, SectionList) that provides the scroll behavior, where you will be able to access their owns methods.

The reference will change depending of the props you are using:

- `children`/`scrollViewProps` -> ScrollView [methods](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview#methods), [types](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react-native/index.d.ts#L6520-L6560)
- `flatListProps` -> FlatList [methods](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#methods), [types](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react-native/index.d.ts#L4084-L4139)
- `sectionListProps` -> SectionList [methods](https://reactnative.dev/docs/sectionlist#methods), [types](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/blob/master/types/react-native/index.d.ts#L4322-L4353)

```tsx
import { Modalize } from 'react-native-modalize';
import { ScrollView, Animated } from 'react-native';

const App = () => {
  const contentRef = useRef<Animated.AnimatedComponent<ScrollView>>(null);

  // e.g. contentRef.current?.getScrollResponder().scrollTo(...);

  return <Modalize contentRef={contentRef} />;
};
```

To get the types from TypeScript, you will need to do like below. Since the content renderer is wrapped with an Animated component you need to extends it with the AnimatedComponent type.

To find the path to each of the function it will depend what content renderer you are using and which version of `react-native` you are running. On latest `react-native`, it should be like in the example above: `contentRef.getScrollResponder().scrollTo(...)` or `contentRef.getScrollResponder().scrollToIndex(...)`, etc.. On older version, most likely something like `contentRef.getNode().getScrollResponder().scrollTo(...)`.

| Type            | Required |
| --------------- | -------- |
| React.RefObject | No       |

## Renderers

Modalize is shipped by default with four different renderers. The default one is a ScrollView and you just have to pass your content without specifying it directly. If you want to use a FlatList or a SectionList, then you don't have to pass the `children` props, but the `data`/`renderItem` that you can normally find with both of them. You also have the possibility to pass your `customRenderer` with this props.

### `children`

A React node that will define the content of the modal. By passing a children props it will use the default `ScrollView` component.

| Type | Required |
| ---- | -------- |
| node | No       |

### `scrollViewProps`

An object to pass any of the react-native ScrollView's props.

Refer to the [`react-native` ScrollView documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/scrollview#props) to find out all the available props.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| object | No       |

### `flatListProps`

An object to pass any of the react-native FlatList's props. Using this props will replace the default `ScrollView` with the `FlatList` component.

Refer to the [`react-native` FlatList documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flatlist#props) to find out all the available props.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| object | No       |

### `sectionListProps`

An object to pass any of the react-native SectionList's props. Using this props will replace the default `ScrollView` with the `SectionList` component.

Refer to the [`react-native` SectionList documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/sectionlist#props) to find out all the available props.

| Type   | Required |
| ------ | -------- |
| object | No       |

### `customRenderer`

- `speed`: Controls speed of the animation. _Default 14_.
- `bounciness`: Controls bounciness. _Default 4_.
- `stiffness`: The spring stiffness coefficient.
- `damping`: Defines how the spring’s motion should be damped due to the forces of friction.
- `mass`: The mass of the object attached to the end of the spring.

**Timing props**

- `duration`: Length of animation (milliseconds). _Default 280_.
- `easing`: Easing function to define curve. _Default is `Easing.ease`_.
- `delay`: Start the animation after delay (milliseconds).
- `isInteraction`: Whether or not this animation creates an "interaction handle" on the InteractionManager.

### `closeAnimationConfig`

Object to change the close animation. You can either pass a timing (`Animated.timing`) or a spring (`Animated.spring`) animation. _(See above for spring and timing props)_

| Type   | Required | Default                                    |
| ------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------ |

| ------ | -------- | ------- |
| number | No       | `150`   |

### `velocity`

Speed at which the user has to pan down to close the modal.

The highest the number is, the faster the user will need to pan down and make an important gesture to dismiss the modal.

?> e.g. When the user is reaching the top of the ScrollView and is immediately panning down to dismiss Modalize. If it reaches the velocity threshold then it instantly closes the modal.

?> If the `velocity` is defined, then it's the first condition checked to close Modalize, then comes `threshold` used in a second time. If you want to use the `threshold` method only, just define `velocity={undefined}`.

| Type   | Required  | Default |
| ------ | --------- | ------- |
| number | undefined | No      | `2800` |

### `panGestureAnimatedValue`

Animated.Value of the modal opening position between 0 and 1.

| -------------- | -------- |
| Animated.Value | No       |

### `useNativeDriver`

Wether or not you want to use the native driver with the `panGestureAnimatedValue`.
