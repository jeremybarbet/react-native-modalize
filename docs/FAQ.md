**I'm using a bottom tabs navigation and Modalize is shown behind it?**

In this context you have two solutions:

- **Recommended**: Install the package [`react-native-portalize`](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/react-native-portalize) to be able to render Modalize on top of everything (it also works for anything else you want)
- Either you use `withReactModal` props (see below for more details)

**Can I use `withReactModal` props?**

For a long time, using Modalize along with `react-native`'s `Modal` component wasn't working on Android because of an issue. In a recent release of [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://github.com/software-mansion/react-native-gesture-handler/pull/937) it has now been fixed. You will need at least `react-native-gesture-handler >= 1.6.0` in order to work.

**Swipe gestures are not working on Android, what did I miss?**

You might have forgot to complete [`react-native-gesture-handler`](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/)'s setup steps for Android.

**I have an issue with Expo SDK v32, what's happening?**

Expo SDK v32 is using an old version of `react-native-gesture-handler` which has an issue with the gesture event. It makes `Modalize` not working, I recommend you upgrading to SDK v33 that fixed the problem.

**Can I make a vertical ScrollView inside the modal?**

First, this is an anti-pattern behavior. You shouldn't have two verticals ScrollView wrapped together. But yes, it's possible. You will have to import the one from `react-native-gesture-handler`.

```tsx
import { ScrollView } from 'react-native-gesture-handler';
```
