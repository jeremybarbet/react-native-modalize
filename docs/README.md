# Modalize

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize)

A modal that loves scrollable content.

This component has been built with `react-native-gesture-handler` to address the common issue of **scrolling**, **swipping** and handling the **keyboard** behaviors, you can face with react-native's modal. This component comes with a ScrollView, the default content renderer, a FlatList and a SectionList. They are all three built-in and make your life easier, just pass your content and Modalize will handle the rest for you.
