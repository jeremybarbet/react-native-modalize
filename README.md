A modal that loves ScrollViews.

This component had been built with `react-native-gesture-handler` to address the common issue of scrolling and swipping behaviors you can face with a modal with react-native. This component is built-in with a `ScrollView`, you don't have to include it by yourself, just pass your content, and the component will handle the rest for you.
