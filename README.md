**This package is still in an early stage, use it with caution.** 🖖

A modal that loves scrollable content.

This component had been built with `react-native-gesture-handler` to address the common issue of scrolling, swipping and handling the keyboard behaviors, you can face with a modal with react-native. This component comes with a ScrollView, the default content renderer, a FlatList and a SectionList. They are all three built-in and make your life easier, just pass your content and Modalize will handle the rest for you.

It resolves the following issues:

- Swipping to dismiss Modalize
- Scrolling within a ScrollView
- Handling the keyboard automatically
