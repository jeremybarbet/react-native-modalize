# Modalize

[![npm version](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/js/react-native-modalize)

> ðŸš¨ **Warning** If you are using `expo`, the latest version makes the scroll/swipe behavior not usable. You need to use `"expo": "31.0.0"` and `"react-native": "https://github.com/expo/react-native/archive/sdk-31.0.0.tar.gz"` to make it works properly. I will dig in to see what's the issue.

<hr>

A modal that loves scrollable content.

This component has been built with `react-native-gesture-handler` to address the common issue of **scrolling**, **swipping** and handling the **keyboard** behaviors, you can face with react-native's modal.

This component comes with a ScrollView, the default content renderer, a FlatList and a SectionList. They are all three built-in and make your life easier, just pass your content and Modalize will handle the rest for you.

## Usage

Here is the quick how-to example:

```jsx
import React, { PureComponent, createRef } from 'react';
import { View, Text, TouchableOpacity } from 'react-native';
import Modalize from 'react-native-modalize';

export default class MyApp extends PureComponent {

  modal = createRef();

  onOpen = () => {
    if (this.modal.current) {
      this.modal.current.open();
    }
  }

  render () {
    return (
      <View>
        <TouchableOpacity onPress={this.onOpen}>
          <Text>Open the modal</Text>
        </TouchableOpacity>

        <Modalize ref={this.modal}>
          ...your content
        </Modalize>
      </View>
    );
  }
