## [2.0.0] - 2020-05-05

### Really happy to release this brand new major version for react-native-modalize.

I have been working on it for the last couple of weeks. Many thanks for the people who contributed, opened PR and found issues. High five to [@xxsnakerxx](https://github.com/xxsnakerxx) for having contributing many times in the last few weeks!

- I rewrote the package using function component, that makes the library lighter, faster and using the latest React practices.
- I also rewrote and reorganize most of the documentation to be easier to read, with way more information about the props, methods, usages and more examples.
- Finally, there was a lot of issues about Modalize not being able to be displayed on top of a bottom tab navigation (e.g. with react-navigation). I released a new package called [`react-native-portalize`](https://github.com/jeremybarbet/react-native-portalize) to be able to solve this issue. It works with Modalize but can also be useful in other context.

### ðŸ’£ Breaking change

- The required `ref` to open or close Modalize is still the same `ref={modalizeRef}`, `modalizeRef.current.open()`. However, you won't be able to access `scrollTo`, `scrollToIndex` on the content renderer using this ref anymore. You will need to use the new ref [`contentRef`](/https://jeremybarbet.github.io/react-native-modalize/#/PROPS?id=contentref) that will give you access to the content methods. `contentRef={contentRef}`, `contentRef.current.getScrollResponder().scrollTo(...)`. "content" stands for ScrollView, FlatList or SectionList depending the content renderer you are using.

### ðŸŽ‰ New features
